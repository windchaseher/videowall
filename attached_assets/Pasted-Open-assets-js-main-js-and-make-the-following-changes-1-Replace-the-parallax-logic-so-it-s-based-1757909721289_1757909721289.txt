Open /assets/js/main.js and make the following changes:

1) Replace the parallax logic so it’s based on each element’s position in the viewport (element-relative),
   not on global scrollY. This makes motion visible near the top and consistent down the page.

Find the existing applyParallax() and replace it with EXACTLY:

  let ticking = false;
  function applyParallax() {
    const viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2;
    // Use a cached NodeList each frame to avoid layout thrash
    document.querySelectorAll('.clip').forEach(el => {
      const s = parseFloat(el.dataset.speed || '0') || 0;
      if (!s) { el.style.transform = ''; return; }
      const rect = el.getBoundingClientRect();
      const elCenter = rect.top + rect.height / 2;
      const delta = viewportCenter - elCenter; // positive when element is below center
      el.style.transform = `translateY(${delta * s}px)`;
    });
    ticking = false;
  }
  // Keep the same scroll listener but also listen to resize and load:
  const onScroll = () => { if (!ticking) { ticking = true; requestAnimationFrame(applyParallax); } };
  window.addEventListener('scroll', onScroll, { passive: true });
  window.addEventListener('resize', onScroll);
  window.addEventListener('load', onScroll);
  applyParallax();

2) Clamp overlaps at build time so clips never cover each other completely.
   In the section where each clip wrapper is created (look for: if (typeof c.overlap === 'number' ...)),
   replace that line with:

    let ov = (typeof c.overlap === 'number' ? c.overlap : -10);
    // Clamp to a safe range (subtle overlap only)
    ov = Math.max(-12, Math.min(-6, ov));
    if (i > 0) wrap.style.marginTop = `${ov}px`;

3) (Optional but recommended) Add a tiny bottom spacing so even with overlaps,
   clips never read as a single block. Right after setting marginTop above, add:
    wrap.style.marginBottom = '4px';

4) Do NOT change any other behavior (Vimeo URL builder, autoplay/mute/loop, watermark, audio).

After changes, run the external preview and verify:
- Parallax is visible in the top third of the page (each clip has gentle motion as it enters).
- No clip is nearly/fully covering the next one.
- Overall motion feels consistent from top to bottom.
