Prompt — Stabilize mobile lazy embedding (disable recycling on phones, ensure eager first load)

Open /assets/js/main.js and update the lazy-embed block as follows:

1) Keep preconnect tags in index.html (no change).

2) Add/confirm this flag near the top (after 'use strict'):
const isSmall = window.matchMedia('(max-width: 768px)').matches;

3) Set device-specific limits (more conservative on phones):
const frames = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.frame'));
const maxConcurrentLoads = isSmall ? 2 : 8;
const rootMarginY         = isSmall ? '1200px' : '2400px';

4) REMOVE mobile recycling. Implement unmount helpers only for desktop:
- If you previously had a Set "mounted" and unmountIframe/unmountFarthest logic, wrap ALL unmounting in:
if (!isSmall) { /* existing unmount/recycling code here */ }
- On mobile (isSmall === true), DO NOT unmount/recycle at all.

5) Ensure at least one frame mounts immediately on EVERY device:
frames.forEach((f, idx) => {
  if (idx === 0) mountIframe(f);        // eager mount the first clip always
});

6) Keep IntersectionObserver simple and NEVER unmount on mobile:
const io = ('IntersectionObserver' in window)
  ? new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
      entries.forEach(e => {
        if (e.isIntersecting) {
          mountIframe(e.target);
          // Keep observing; do NOT unobserve here
        } else {
          // Desktop-only recycling (optional)
          if (!isSmall) {
            // If far off-screen, you may unmount here as before; otherwise do nothing
          }
        }
      });
    }, { root: null, rootMargin: `${rootMarginY} 0px`, threshold: 0.01 })
  : null;

frames.forEach(f => { if (io) io.observe(f); else mountIframe(f); });

7) IMPORTANT: In mountIframe(frame), prevent double-queueing and make “settle” safe:
- Before pushing to queue, check it's not already queued/mounted.
- When unmounting on desktop (if you keep that), make sure you never unmount a frame before its settle() has run.
- Always decrement inFlight in settle(), and ensure a load timeout still fires even if the iframe was removed.

Do NOT change Vimeo URL builder, watermark, audio, or parallax logic.

After changes, open the external preview on iPhone and verify:
- The very first clip appears quickly without refreshing.
- As you scroll, additional clips appear (no permanent blanks).
- Desktop still loads smoothly.
