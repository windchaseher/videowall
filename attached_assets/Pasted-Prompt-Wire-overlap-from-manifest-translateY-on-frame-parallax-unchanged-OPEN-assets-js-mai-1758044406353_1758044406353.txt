Prompt — “Wire overlap from manifest (translateY on .frame, parallax unchanged)”
OPEN /assets/js/main.js

Goal:
Make manifest.json "overlap" values actually shift clips vertically.
Apply overlap as translateY on the INNER `.frame` so it never conflicts with parallax (which transforms the OUTER `.clip`).

Steps:

1) Add a kill switch near the top (after 'use strict'):
window.__OVERLAP_ENABLED ??= true;

2) In the render-from-manifest section (where each clip DOM is built), locate code similar to:
  const wrap = document.createElement('section'); // class 'clip'
  wrap.className = 'clip';
  const frame = document.createElement('div');    // class 'frame'
  frame.className = 'frame';
  // ... set frame.dataset.embed = buildVimeoUrl(c.embedUrl) ...
  // ... wrap.appendChild(frame) ...

Immediately after creating `frame` (before appending), read and apply overlap:

  // Read overlap (pixels) from manifest; store for debug
  const ov = (typeof c.overlap === 'number') ? c.overlap : parseFloat(c.overlap || '0') || 0;
  wrap.dataset.title = c.title || '';
  wrap.dataset.overlap = String(ov);

  // Apply overlap to the INNER frame (no conflict with parallax on wrapper)
  if (window.__OVERLAP_ENABLED) {
    // Negative ov pulls the frame upward; positive pushes it down
    const prev = frame.style.transform || '';
    // Ensure we don't overwrite any existing frame transform (rare); append translate
    frame.style.transform = `${prev ? prev + ' ' : ''}translate3d(0, ${ov}px, 0)`;
    frame.style.willChange = 'transform';
  }

3) Do NOT modify the parallax code. It must continue to set `transform` ONLY on `.clip` wrappers.

4) (Optional quick sanity print; add once at end of render):
  try {
    const rows = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.clip')).map((el,i) => ({
      idx: i, title: el.dataset.title || '', overlap: el.dataset.overlap
    }));
    console.table(rows);
  } catch {}

5) SAVE /assets/js/main.js.

6) OPEN /assets/css/style.css (or wherever `.frame` styles live):
   - Ensure there is NO other hard-coded `transform` on `.frame`. Remove it if present.
   - (No change needed if `.frame` didn’t have a transform.)

7) OPEN /index.html and bump the cache-buster on main.js (increment the `?v=` number on the script tag) so the new JS is loaded.

Validation (external preview, mobile & desktop):
- HYBRID_FIELD / HYBRID_SKY / HYBRID_HOUSE visibly shift according to their `overlap` values already in manifest.
- Parallax still works exactly as before (on `.clip`).
- If you need to compare quickly, disable the feature at runtime:
    window.__OVERLAP_ENABLED = false; location.reload();
